               <p style="font-size:20px ;">Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollution is divided into three types</p>

               <p style="font-size:20px ; ">Water pollution is any change, minor or major in the physical, chemical or biological properties of water that eventually leads to a detrimental consequence of any living organism. Drinking water, called Potable Water, is considered safe enough for human and animal consumption. </p>

               <p style="font-size:20px ; ">Noise pollution is when the level of noise increases more than the normal level. When the amount of noise exceeds, it becomes dangerous for living beings. Moreover, these unpleasant sounds cause several disturbances and create an imbalance in the environment. In other words, high volume noises are abnormal. </p>

The unintended consequences of pesticides is one of the main drivers of the negative<br >impact of modern industrial agriculture on the environment. Pesticides, because they are toxic chemicals meant to kill pest species, can affect non-target species, <br>such as plants, animals and humans. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, because they are sprayed or spread across entire agricultural fields.[1] Other agrochemicals, such as fertilizers, can also have negative effects on the environment.</p>

               <p style="font-size:20px ;">In this paragraph, we will focus on the harmful effects of deforestation. The effects of deforestation can be jotted down. The first effect of deforestation is the degradation of soil quality.<br> Degradation of soil quality is triggered by the removal of the topsoil layer. The trees hold on to the topsoil with their roots. The roots are used to derive nutrients from the soil.<br> When deforestation occurs, the trees are either cut down or uprooted. The former leads to soil loosening and the <br>later causes the roots to decay. Decaying roots increase the number of alkaline salts in the soil, making them unfit for agriculture.</p>

No living organism can ever survive without water. Water is also required for agricultural and industrial activities, other than for routine tasks. Today, we are unaware of the dangers posed by water wastage. We make only a feeble attempt to conserve water. Water is wasted in social gatherings, programmes, and celebrations. Every day, we waste water in our homes as well. We have this habit of leaving the tap open while brushing, washing, bathing, etc. So, significant actions must be taken to conserve water.</p>
